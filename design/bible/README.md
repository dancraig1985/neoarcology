## The World in Brief

NeoArcology is a living city that runs autonomously. Agents wake up, get hungry, go to work, buy food, and sometimes start their own businesses. The economy emerges from these individual decisions.

### Core Loop

1. **Time passes** - Agents get hungrier
2. **Agents eat** - From their personal inventory
3. **Agents buy** - When they run out of food
4. **Shops restock** - From wholesale suppliers
5. **Factories produce** - Using worker labor
6. **Everyone gets paid** - Weekly salaries and dividends
7. **Repeat**

### Key Principles

- **Agents are autonomous** - They make their own decisions based on needs and opportunities
- **Money must circulate** - Revenue flows to businesses, wages flow to workers, spending flows back
- **Everything has a cost** - Operating a business costs money; no free lunches
- **Death is permanent** - Agents who starve are gone forever
- **Businesses need owners** - When an owner dies, their business closes
